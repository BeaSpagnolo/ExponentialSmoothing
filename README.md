# ExponentialSmoothing
This repository contains the work related to my thesis, which focuses on the application of Exponential Smoothing methods, specifically Simple, Double, and Triple Exponential Smoothing, for forecasting future data.

## Application of Exponential Smoothing methods for forecasting
Exponential Smoothing methods are widely used for time series forecasting in business contexts. They form a robust foundation for improving sales forecasts and inventory management. These techniques smooth out past data and capture patterns such as trends and seasonality to make more accurate predictions.

## Methods Covered
- Simple Exponential Smoothing: Best for data with no clear trend or seasonality.
- Double Exponential Smoothing (Holtâ€™s Method): Suitable for data with a trend but no seasonality.
- Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method): Designed for data with both a trend and seasonality.

## Case Study
During my internship at the startup Humco Srl, I had the opportunity to observe the real-world application of these methods. I worked with actual datasets, analyzing historical series and implementing forecasting techniques to solve real business challenges. The case studies included sales forecasting and stock optimization, demonstrating the impact of these methods on decision-making processes.

## Contents
The repository includes R scripts for implementing the three Exponential Smoothing methods and the PDF of the thesis.
